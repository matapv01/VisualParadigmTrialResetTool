## 📦 (Optional) Build into a Standalone `.exe`

If you don't want users to install Python, you can package the script into a `.exe` file.

### Steps to build:

1. Install `pyinstaller`:

    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2. Build the `.exe` file:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile vpreset.py
    ```

3. After building, your `.exe` will be located inside the `dist` folder.

4. You can now run the `.exe` directly without needing Python!
